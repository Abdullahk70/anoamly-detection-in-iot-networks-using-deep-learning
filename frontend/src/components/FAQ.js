      question: "What is feature engineering, and why is it essential?",
      answer:
        "Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features to better represent the underlying problem to predictive models. Itâ€™s a critical step as it can significantly enhance model performance and accuracy.",
    },
    {
      question: "What normalization techniques does the app support?",
      answer:
        "The app currently supports Z-scaling, a method that standardizes data by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This normalization ensures consistent scaling, which is essential for algorithms sensitive to feature magnitudes.",
    },
    {
      question: "What methods are available for outlier detection?",
      answer:
        "Our app includes three outlier detection techniques:\n\n1. Z-Score Analysis\n\n2. Interquartile Range (IQR)\n\n3. Isolation Forest",
    },
    {
      question: "How does the app handle data visualization?",
      answer:
        "The app offers interactive line and scatter plots. These visualizations allow users to explore data trends, identify clusters, and detect anomalies in a visually intuitive way.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is label encoding, and how does it work?",
      answer:
        "Label encoding is a technique to convert categorical labels into numeric values. It assigns a unique integer to each category, enabling seamless integration into machine learning models.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I export the processed data?",
      answer:
        "Yes, once your data has been processed, you can export it in CSV or Excel format. This ensures compatibility with various downstream applications and machine learning pipelines.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is the app optimized for large datasets?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. The app uses efficient algorithms and asynchronous operations to handle large datasets, ensuring smooth performance even with millions of rows.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does the app support real-time data processing?",
      answer:
        "Currently, the app is designed for batch processing. However, near-real-time data handling can be achieved with periodic updates, and real-time capabilities are on our development roadmap.",
    },
